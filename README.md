Lab 1: Building a simulator

Due: Thursday, February 1, 2024, 11:59 PM
Objective: The primary goal of this lab is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts behind robotic simulators. Throughout this session, we will not only delve into the theoretical aspects of simulation but also apply this knowledge practically by building and testing our own robot simulator.

In this first lab practice, we'll revisit Python programming to construct a robot simulator.

Part 1: Review concepts about the point robot

Read Chapters 1 and 2 of the course notes
Follow the steps in Section 2.4 to build a simulator in Python.
Test your simulator with a line trajectory and a circular trajectory. 
Tip: You can use Jupyter Notebook. Here you can find example code for the simulator.

Part 2: Design a controller to follow an elliptical trajectory (Chapter 2)

Answer the following exercises, depending on the course:

Exercises 1, 3 for CSE360 studentsâ€‹ (exercise 2 is optional).
Exercises 1,2, and 3 for 460 students
Part 3: Simulate windy conditions (Chapter 2)
Solve Excercise 4 for both wind conditions. 

Create a repository in Github, and upload the code of your solution there.

Report
Write a report in the IEEE format that includes the following information:
Solution of the exercise(s). Including the equation of the function u(t) and how you calculated it.
A figure of the output path for each excercise.
Link to the GitHub repository where the code of your solution is.
Upload a PDF with your report
Deadline: Thursday February 1, 2024
